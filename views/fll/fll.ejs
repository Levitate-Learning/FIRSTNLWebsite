    <p>
        The FIRST LEGO League Challenge competition consists of four pillars. Prior to the competition, 
        your team will <b>build a robot</b> using a <b>LEGO SPIKE Prime</b> robot kit and optional LEGO SPIKE Prime expansion set. 
        Your objective is to use your robot to complete as many tasks as possible in <b>2.5 minutes on the competition table.</b> 
        As well, you you will prepare a <b>“science fair” like project</b> called the <b>innovation project.</b> 
        At this competition, you <b>compete in the robot game</b>, and <b>present your robot design and innovation project</b> in a presentation to a panel of judges.
